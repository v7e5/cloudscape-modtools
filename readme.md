# Cloudscape Modtools

A set of tools and scripts to automate the process of transforming [AWS UI
Cloudscape Components](https://cloudscape.design) to Remix compatible UI
components.  

This project makes heavy use of [ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io/) for all
kinds of code transformations, along with ZSH shell scripts and nodejs tools.
The final output i.e. the transformed components can be found in my
[remix-cloudscape repo](https://github.com/v7e5/remix-cloudscape) under the
`src/components` directory.
